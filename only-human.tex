  \maketitle

  A simple tabletop RPG framework, for when you don't want superhuman characters. It requires a game master (GM) to run the world / non-player characters (NPCs), and at least $1$ player to run the player character(s) (PCs).

  To play, everyone should have d20s and paper, pencils, and erases to record character details and notes. The GM should have a story, and details of relevant items, roles, and mechanics (see the Still Human section for examples).

  \section*{CORE RULES}

  \subsection*{Character Creation}

  Before the game, the players each create a character. To do so, they allocate $12$ points between four \textbf{stats}: Dexterity (DEX), Intelligence (INT), Strength (STR), and Will (WIL). Each \textbf{stat} may not be allocated more than $6$ points.

  Players also allocate $16$ points to \textbf{skills}. The GM may provide the option to pick a \textbf{role}, which confers an additional $4$ points that must be allocated within a particular set of \textbf{skills}. No skill can be allocated more than $4$ points.

  Each \textbf{skill} is associated with two \textbf{stats}. Below are some \textbf{skills}, but you can add other \textbf{skills} to the game, with the agreement of the GM and after associating the \textbf{skill} with a pair of \textbf{stats}.

  \begin{multicols}{2}
    DEX + DEX: ​\textit{Agility​},​ \textit{Sleight of hand}

    DEX + INT: \textit{​Ranged attacking​}

    DEX + STR: ​\textit{Speed}

    DEX + SPT: ​\textit{Stealth}

    INT + INT: ​\textit{Technology​},​ \textit{Medicine}

    INT + STR: ​\textit{Melee attacking}

    INT + SPT: \textit{Investigation}, \textit{Insight}

    STR + STR: \textit{​Athletics}

    STR + SPT: \textit{​Toughness}, \textit{Intimidation}

    SPT + SPT: ​\textit{Persuasion}
  \end{multicols}

  Keep in mind that couple of numbers should not totally describe your character. Think about their personality, about what they want, what they need (but might not know they need), and how they know the other characters in the group. Have secrets for your character, but want them to be discovered.

  \subsection*{Tests}

  When a character tries something with a chance of both failure and success, the GM may have them take a \textbf{​test}​ in a \textbf{skill}: their controlling player (or the GM for NPCs) rolls a d20, adds the character's \textbf{modifier} in the \textbf{skill}, and the GM compares that to a \textbf{difficulty} they have set. If the \textbf{test} result is at least the \textbf{difficulty} then the \textbf{test} is a success, otherwise it is a failure.

  To find the character's \textbf{skill} \textbf{modifier} add together their points in the associated \textbf{stats} and divide this by $2$ rounding down (giving the \textbf{stat's} points for \textbf{skills} associated with the same \textbf{stat} twice) then add their points in the \textbf{skill}. References to a \textbf{skill} in a numerical context refer to this \textbf{modifier}.

  \subsection*{Contests}

  \textbf{Contests} are special kinds of \textbf{tests} for when two or more characters are simultaneously attempting tasks that come into conflict. Each character takes a \textbf{test} in the \textbf{skill} relevant to the task they are attempting. The character(s) with the highest result succeeds, and all other characters fail (perhaps to varying degrees). The GM adjudicates the outcome of any ties.

  \subsection*{Turns}

  When things get tense characters start taking turns. The turn order, and whether or not they overlap, is up to the GM. Everyone taking a turn represents about 10 seconds of time. During a turn, characters may move, and once per turn (possibly during that movement) they may take an ​\textbf{action​}. Characters may also talk at any point during turns, but the GM should ensure they don’t communicate more than is reasonable for the elapsed time.
  
  \textbf{Attacking}, \textbf{running}, \textbf{readying}, some object interactions, or trying to \textbf{stabalise} a character are all actions. As is anything else the GM deems to be.
  

  \subsection*{Moving}

  When characters move, they can move in a path of up to $10 + (2 \times Speed)$ metres. If a character is climbing, swimming, sneaking, carrying something bulky, moving over difficult ground, or otherwise slowed, then they are \textbf{restricted}. The distance a character moves whilst \textbf{restricted} counts twice against their movement.

  \subsection*{Actions}

  To \textbf{attack}, a character must be within their weapon's range of their target, and there must be nothing fully blocking the \textbf{attack}. The attacker then makes the relevant of either a \textit{​Ranged attacking​} or a \textit{​Melee attacking​​}  \textbf{test​}, adding their weapon's modifier, and subtracting $2$ for ranged attacks if the attacker is within $2$ metres of the target. The \textbf{difficulty} for this ​\textbf{test​} is $10 + target\:DEX + cover$, where $cover$ is $4$ if the attacker can only see less than half of the target, and $0$ otherwise.

  If the attacker fails, nothing happens. Otherwise, the attack has an \textbf{impact} of the amount the \textbf{test} \textbf{difficulty} was exceeded, minus the absorption of any armour the target is wearing. The target then takes a \textbf{difficulty} $15 + impact$ \textit{Toughness} \textbf{test}. If they fail they get \textbf{injured} and become \textbf{unstable}. If they fail by $10$ to $14$ they get \textbf{injured} twice, if they fail by $15$ or more they get \textbf{injured} three times.

  If a character \textbf{runs} they double the distance they are permitted to move in the current turn. If a character \textbf{readies} their player must specify a condition and an \textbf{action}. If the condition occurs before their next turn, their character immediately takes the action.

  \subsection*{Injury}

  Characters have a \textbf{health state} and are either \textbf{stable} or \textbf{unstable}. If a character gets \textbf{injured} they drop to the next \textbf{health state} down the table. If they are \textbf{unstable} in the same \textbf{health state} for more than $30$ minutes, their player rolls d20. On an $11$ or higher they become \textbf{stable}, on a $10$ or lower they get \textbf{injured}. A successful \textbf{difficulty} $11$ \textit{Medicine} \textbf{test} will \textbf{stabilise} a character, but true recovery can require days or specialised equipment.

  \begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}{lX}
    Health State & Effect on Character \\
    \hline
    Normal & They're fine. Characters start \textbf{stable} in this state. \\
    Wounded & They're hurt, they suffer a $-2$ penalty to all \textbf{tests}. \\
    Seriously Wounded & They're \textit{really} hurt, they suffer a $-4$ penalty to all \textbf{tests} and are \textbf{restricted}. \\
    Incapacitated & They're (effectively) unconscious. They cannot voluntarily do anything. You do not add their DEX to the \textbf{difficulty} of \textbf{tests} to attack them. \\
    Dead & They're dead, Jim.
  \end{tabularx}

  \section*{STILL HUMAN}

  A sci-fi expansion for ONLY HUMAN designed to work with teams of characters sent on missions in reasonably hard sci-fi near-ish future settings.

  This should not be the only style or setting that ONLY HUMAN is able to be played in, and hopefully this section also serves to provide an example of how this game can actually be implemented into something playable in general.

  \subsection*{Equipment}

  \begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}{lX}
    Armour (Absorption) & Description / Effects \\
    \hline
    Normal Clothes (0) & Stylish \textit{and} practical. \\
    Space Suit (1) & A surprisingly compact vacuum rated environmental suit good for $2$ hours of exposure, with oxygen tanks that can be refilled whenever it is back in atmosphere. If the suit absorbs any damage it is torn, and must be repaired before it will be vacuum worthy. All movement whilst wearing a space suit is effectively through difficult terrain. \\
    Reinforced Space Suit (2) & A military grade space suit. The same as a space suit, except it is only torn if its wearer is hit with an attack and it cannot absorb all the \textbf{impact} \\
    Combat Armour (2) & Tactical body armour. \\
    Combat Carapace (3) & Heavy duty body armour. All movement whilst wearing combat carapace is effectively through difficult terrain.
  \end{tabularx}

  \begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}{lXX}
    Weapon (Type) & Range & Modifier \\
    \hline
    Improvised Weapon (Melee) & $2m$ & $-2$ \\
    Shock Rod (Melee) & $2m$ & $+2$ \\
    Combat Knife (Melee) & $1m$ & $+1$ \\
    Auto Pistol (Ranged) & $50m$ & $+1$ \\
    Assault Rifle (Ranged) & $400m$ & $+3$ \\
    Improvised Weapon (Ranged) & $10m$ & $-4$ \\
    Combat Knife (Ranged) & $10m$ & $+0$
  \end{tabularx}

  \begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}{lX}
    Other Items & Description / Effects \\
    \hline
    Short Range Communicator & A small radio device. Provides encrypted communication with other short range communicators configured to allow it within 20km. \\
    Long Range Communicator & A backpack sized radio device that provides encrypted communication to any equipment configured to receive it within 40,000km. \\
    Pad & A smartphone sized, portable, touch screen computer. \\
    Navigator & A small attachment to a pad that uses known maps, available satellite data, and computer vision to attempt to inform the user of their position at all times. \\
    Scanner & A small attachment to a pad that allows various kinds of scanning. Where relevant, a scanner gives a $+2$ modifier to \textit{Investigation} \textbf{tests}. \\
    Medical Kit & A brief-case sized box containing various medical supplies. Where relevant, a medical kit gives a $+2$ modifier to \textit{Medicine} \textbf{tests}. Additionally, the medical kit contains $5$ stim-shots, that can be used to rouse an unconscious character to the seriously wounded health state, and a single charge defibrillator that can be used to revive a dead character that has died in the last minute from causes that would be resolved by restarting their heart. \\
    Engineering Kit & A vacuum rated toolbox full of various equipment for dealing with the tech a space-faring engineer might expect to encounter. An engineering kit gives a $+2$ modifier to \textit{Technology} \textbf{tests} made to repair things. Additionally, the engineering kit contains $5$ patches that can be used to repair tears in space suits.
  \end{tabularx}

  \subsection*{Team Building}

  Still Human provides two methods of building up the team of player characters. Selected roles, or requirements and requisitioning. Whilst these methods do provide equipment, it is generally assumed that everyone has normal clothes, a space suit, a short range communicator, and a pad. Still Human also adds a single \textbf{skill} to the game: \textit{Piloting}, a DEX + INT \textbf{skill}.

  \subsection*{Roles}

  In this method, every character can have a specialisation, or role. The below table provides some examples of rules. Characters in a role gain all of the equipment in the equipment column, and may either take experience in one of the \textbf{skills} in the \textbf{proficiencies} column, or training in two of them (in addition to their base \textbf{proficiencies}).

  \begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}{lXX}
    Role & Proficiencies & Equipment \\
    \hline
    Pilot & \textit{Piloting} and \textit{Investigation} & Navigator \\
    Communications & \textit{Technology}, \textit{Insight} and \textit{Persuasion} & Long Range Communicator \\
    Security & \textit{Ranged attacking}, \textit{Melee attacking}, and \textit{Toughness} & Reinforced Space Suit, Assault Rifle, and Shock Rod \\
    Engineering & \textit{Slight of hand}, \textit{Piloting} and \textit{Technology} & Engineering Kit \\
    Medical & \textit{Slight of hand} and \textit{Medicine} & Medical Kit \\
    Science & \textit{Technology} and \textit{Investigation} & Scanner
  \end{tabularx}

  \subsection*{Requirements and Requisitioning}

  An alternative is to come up with a list of required proficiencies for the group, e.g. "We need people experienced in piloting and investigation, and someone trained in both technology and slight of hand", and let the group work out how they will fill those niches together. Similarly, a pool of equipment can be provided, for the group to share out. This could lead to relations forming between the characters whilst they are being created.

  \section{GM TIPS}

  To fit the core rules on one page ONLY HUMAN is necessarily rather rules light. This is very intentional, based around the idea that the fundamental core of an RPG (especially once you take away supernatural powers and progression) is incredibly simple. So, whilst the core game is playable with only the addition of a story and some equipment stats, this section provides some suggestions for how the GM could expand the game, and adjudicate complex situations.

  \subsection*{Setting DCs}

  When setting DCs, generally keep in mind these difficulty levels:

  \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{ lr }
      Difficulty & DC \\
      \hline
      Very Easy & $5$ \\
      Easy & $10$ \\
      Moderately Complicated & $15$ \\
      Difficult & $20$ \\
      Very Difficult & $25$ \\
      Practically Impossible & $30$
    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}

  Remember, unless you are intentionally trying to hide the difficulty of a task, if a character attempts a task that is impossible to fail, or impossible to successfully complete, there is no need for a \textbf{test}, simply narrate the outcome to the players.

  \subsection*{Adjudicating Complex Tasks}

  ONLY HUMAN does not provide specific rules for adjudicating everything a player may wish to try. So, when dealing with non-standard tasks, attempt to find a way to distil them down into one or more core difficulties (parts of the task with a risk of failure and a chance of success) that can be related to \textbf{skills} (whether on the given \textbf{skills} table or not).

  Once you know what \textbf{skills} are involved, try to gauge the difficulty of these components of the task, work out if they happen in an order or at the same time, and work out what success or failure for individual parts or combinations of individual parts looks like. Finally, with these ideas in mind, have the character take \textbf{tests} based on the established skills and difficulties, in the established order, and with the established outcomes.

  \subsection*{Contests}

  Sometimes two or more characters will be simultaneously attempting tasks that come into conflict. A \textbf{contest} can be used to determine the outcome of such a situation. In a \textbf{contest}, the conflicting characters take a \textbf{test} in the \textbf{skill} relevant to what they are doing. The character with the higher result succeeds, and all other characters fail (perhaps to varying degrees).

  For example, if one character wanted to restrain another, preventing them from moving or taking actions, perhaps they could both enter into a \textbf{contest}, with the grappler taking an \textit{Athletics} \textbf{test}, and the grapplee taking a \textit{Athletics} or \textit{Agility} \textbf{test}, depending on how they try to resist.

  Or perhaps if one character is searching for another character that is hiding the \textbf{contest} could be \textit{Investigation} against \textit{Stealth}.

  \subsection*{Turns}

  The core rules do not describe how the order of turns should be determined, and whether or not they can overlap. This should usually be decided on a case by case basis, as there is no one system that is good for every situation. It can be determined by \textit{​Speed} \textbf{contests}, it can just evolve from the scene, characters can be divided into teams that alternate, everyone can go at once, or they can be sequenced through any other method of your own devising.

  \subsection*{Adding to the Game}

  You should feel totally free to add items or rules to the game, it is intentionally simple for that reason. Keep in mind that it is expected for specific rules to override general rules, so don't be afraid of that. Perhaps you want a gun that fires so fast it's wielder effectively shoots twice, or an enemy that can take a lot more hits than a usual character. Don't worry if these things go against the general stuff in the core rules, GMing would be much less fun if the players knew how everything worked. This sections details some example additions.

  \subsection*{Custom Rules}

  You could add to the game the concept of status, a more general version of medical state (perhaps even making medical states types of status). Conditions that can effect characters in certain ways, perhaps given by items or as the effect of being attacked by a weapon. Maybe characters can be temporarily paralysed, charmed, invigorated, or exhausted. Maybe this changes their movement, their abilities to take certain actions, or provides another path to death.

  Additionally you could add other specific uses of \textbf{actions}, such as dashing: making a second move in a turn.

  \subsection*{Custom Equipment}

  Adding additional equipment is also an option, perhaps equipment that varies in more ways than the basic stats allow. Maybe you add a shotgun that can hit everything in a cone up to $10$ metres with a $+4$ or one target with a $+0$ out to $30$ metres.

  \subsection*{Antagonists and Enemies}

  When creating antagonists or enemies do not feel you need to stick to the options available to the player. You may want grunt alien enemies that drop dead on a single \textit{Toughness} \textbf{test} failure, or a villain antagonist so drugged up on stimulants that they are much harder to take down. You may want characters that have better or worse stats than the standard player character creation allows. Go for it.

  \subsection*{Character Equipment}

  Whilst there is no strict limit on how much equipment a character can carry, it is best to be realistic. If you think a player character is carrying too much, perhaps get the player to label where everything is on their character's body. You could also apply strict carry weight rules, such as $40 + 10 \times Athletics$ kilograms of equipment, where \textit{Athletics} is the modifier they would apply to an \textit{Athletics} \textbf{test}. If you wanted to be even more granular you could add that if a character is carrying more than $40 + 5 \times Athletics$ all their movement counts as moving in difficult terrain.
