# Only Human Design Principles

- No hit points.

- Deadliness:
  - Characters without specific protection should be able to be in a dying state after a single (very) successful attack from a normal weapon.
  - This should not, however, be very likely.
  - Healthy characters without specific weaknesses should not be able to be killed outright by a single attack from a normal weapon.

- Cover should be very important.

- Dice:
  - There should only be one kind of die roll.
  - Only one kind of die should be used.
  - Dice should only be rolled if there is a chance of failure, a chance of failure, and a cost of failure.
    - If there is no chance of failure, the attempt just succeeds.
    - If there is no chance of success, the attempt just fails.
    - If there is no cost (including meaningful lost time) of failure, the character simply tries until they succeed.

- Modifiers:
  - Modifiers should range from +0 to +10.
  - A normal person would have a +0 in most things.
  - Characters are generally expected to represent somewhat skilled individuals.
  - This regulates DCs.
  - A DC of 11 has a 50% chance of success for a normal person, and a 100% chance of success for an expert.
  - A DC of 21 has a 0% chance of success for a normal person, and a 50% chance of success for an expert.

- The game should be simple enough to be explained in half an hour.
