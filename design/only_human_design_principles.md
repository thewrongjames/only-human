# Only Human Design Principles

- No hit points.

- Deadliness:
  - Characters without specific protection should be able to be in a dying state after a single (very) successful attack from a normal weapon.
  - This should not, however, be very likely.
  - Healthy characters without specific weaknesses should not be able to be killed outright by a single attack from a normal weapon.

- Cover should be very important.

- Dice:
  - There should only be one kind of die roll.
  - Only one kind of die should be used.
  - Dice should only be rolled if there is a chance of success, a chance of failure, and a cost of failure.
    - If there is no chance of failure, the attempt just succeeds.
    - If there is no chance of success, the attempt just fails.
    - If there is no cost (including meaningful lost time) of failure, the character simply tries until they succeed.

- Modifiers:
  - Character modifiers should range from +0 to +10.
  - A normal person would have a +2 in most things, due to every skill involving two starts, and people having an average of 1 point per stat.
  - This regulates DCs.
  - A DC of 11 has a 50% chance of success for a totally unskilled (+0) person, and a 100% chance of success for an expert (+10).
  - A DC of 21 has a 0% chance of success for a totally unskilled (+0) person, and a 50% chance of success for an expert (+10).
  - Non-human creature modifiers should range from -10 to +20, as this allows them more range to be unable to do, or be unable to fail, certain tasks.

- DCs
  - DCs to do take action against an entity should be 10 + the entity's relevant modifier.
    - This means that DCs against other humans range from 10 ro 20.
    - And that DCs against non-human creatures can range from 0 to 30.
    - That is, there can be non-human creatures that only experts have any chance of dealing with.
  - DCs for tasks should adhere to a similar range, from 5 to 30.

- The game should be simple enough to be explained in half an hour.
