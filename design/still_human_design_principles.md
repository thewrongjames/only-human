# Still Human Design Principles

- The setting should feel believable, most of the technology should simply be modern technology.
  - I don't want to have to learn a lot about guns, so I am comfortable with the weapons being an exception to this.
  - I don't need them to be particularly accurate to reality.
  - However, they should still _feel_ real.
  - So, definitely bullets and not lasers.

- Armour should be specific, important, and effective.

- Managing space suits should be important.
  - Managing any damage to them.
  - Managing how much time worth of breathable air you have.
