# Only Human Rules

Version 0.3.0

This document is designed to outline the rules of the game, without the styling and fluff that might appear in a more polished document. It is not necessarily the nicest way to be introduced to the game, but it should clearly outline how to play and run it.

Only Human is inspired by the [Dead Simple RPG](https://deadsimplerpg.wordpress.com/about/) games.

## Basic Rules

Only Human is a simple tabletop role playing game system, for when you don't need a built in setting, an entire magic / technology system, and godlike progression. It requires a game master (GM) to control the world and non-player characters (NPCs), and at least one player to control the player character(s) (PCs).

This section contains the rules for playing the game, as they pertain to the players. The GM will also likely use some of these rules, but their interactions are outlined further in the [GM Guide](#GM-Guide).

Before playing everyone should have access to at least one d20 (d20s are 20 sided dice), as well as some paper, pencils and erasers to record character details and notes. The GM should have an interesting story or scenario for the player(s) to encounter, and outlines of any mechanics that they expect to use during the game.

### Character Creation

Before playing the game, the players each create a character. When doing so, players must allocate ten points between the four **stats** that characters have: Dexterity (`DEX`), Intelligence (`INT`), Strength(`STR`), and Spirit (`SPT`). Each stat must have between one and four points.

A **skill** is a particular activity or aspect that a character can have different levels of **proficiency** with in. **Skills** are each associated with two **stats**. The list below details some examples of **skills**, but it is not exhaustive: you can add any number of other **skills** to the game pending only the agreement of the GM, and the association of the **skill** with a pair of **stats**.

- `DEX` + `DEX`: *Agility*, *Slight of hand*
- `DEX` + `INT`: *Ranged attacking*
- `DEX` + `STR`: *Speed*
- `DEX` + `SPT`: *Stealth*
- `INT` + `INT`: *Technology*, *Medicine*
- `INT` + `STR`: *Melee attacking*
- `INT` + `SPT`: *Investigation*, *Insight*
- `STR` + `STR`: *Athletics*
- `STR` + `SPT`: *Toughness*, *Intimidation*
- `SPT` + `SPT`: *Persuasion*

Characters begin experienced in one **skill**, and trained in two others; they are considered unfamiliar with everything else. This is their level of **proficiency**. The levels of **proficiency** confer modifiers, the use of these modifiers will be explained in the [Tests](#Tests) section later.

| Level of **proficiency** | Modifier |
| ------------------------ | --------:|
| Unfamiliar               |     `+0` |
| Trained                  |     `+1` |
| Experienced              |     `+2` |

### Playing the Game

#### Tests

When a character tries something that has a risk of failure, and a chance of success, they take a **test**. A **test** must always be associated with a **skill**, which in turn must always be associated with two **stats**. The controlling player of the character in question, or the GM for NPCs, rolls a d20. The points value of each of the character's **stats** that relate to the relevant **skill**, plus the character's **proficiency** modifier for the **skill** are added to the number rolled, and the total is the result of the **test**.

For every **test** taken the GM should choose a difficulty class (DC) that corresponds to the difficulty of the task at hand. A higher DC means the task is more difficult.

If the result of the **test** is at least as high as the DC then the **test** is a success, otherwise it is a failure.

#### Contests

**Contests** are a special kind of **test** for when two or more characters are simultaneously attempting tasks that come into conflict. In a **context** the conflicting characters each take a **test** in the **skill** relevant to the task they are attempting. The character with the highest result succeeds, and all the other characters (perhaps to varying degrees, fail).

#### Turns

When things get tense characters start taking turns. The turn order, and whether or not they overlap, is up to the GM. Everyone taking a turn represents about 10 seconds of time. During a turn, characters may move, and once per turn (possibly during that movement) they may take an ​**action**. Characters may talk at any point during turns, but the GM should to ensure that they don’t communicate more than is reasonable in the amount of time that has elapsed.

#### Moving

When characters make a move, they can move in a path of up to `10 + (2 × Speed)` metres, where _Speed_ is the modifier the character would add to a _Speed_ **test**. If a character is climbing, trying to move stealthily, wearing or carrying something bulky, or moving over difficult terrain, then they are considered **encumbered** can only move in a path of up to `10 + Speed` metres.

#### Actions

As an action characters may attack, dash, restrain, shove, hold an action, or interact substantially with an object.

If a character spends their **action** making an attack, providing the target of their attack is within range of the weapon they are using, and there is nothing physically preventing the attack (such as a wall). If a character cannot see their target, they must declare where they are attacking, if there is nothing there their attack fails, but otherwise it continues as normal. To make an attack characters make the relevant of either a _​Ranged attacking​_ or a _​Melee attacking​​_ **test**, adding their weapon modifier to their result. The DC for this **test** is `10 + target DEX`, but light cover applies a `-2` penalty, and heavy cover applies a `-4` penalty.

If the attacker fails this **test** nothing further happens and the **action** is complete. Otherwise, the attack has an **impact** of the amount they exceeded their attack **test** by (possibly zero), minus the absorption of any armour the target is wearing. The target must then take a _Toughness_ **test**, with a DC of `15 + impact`. If the target fails this **test** they are **injured** and become **unstable**. If they fail by a margin of `10` or more they are **injured** twice.
