# Only Human

## Introduction

Only Human is a very simple tabletop RPG system for when you don't need / want the characters to have super human abilities. It is inspired by the [Dead Simple RPG](https://deadsimplerpg.wordpress.com/about/) games, particularly [Blaster](https://deadsimplerpg.wordpress.com/category/blaster-sf-rpg/), so if you want a similar but quite possibly much better game, take a look at that.

When I first saw the one page version of Blaster (3.5, I think), I was amazed at the idea that you could create a one page RPG that was more than just an (admittedly usually very good) joke. It turns out that when you don't commit to providing an entire magic system, detailed progression, or setting, the solid foundations of an RPG system appear to be able to be rather light.

Fundamentally, what is needed for a role playing game is just a framework within which to adjudicate actions - a system of quantifying how good characters are expected to be at certain things, and whether or not (or the degree to which) they succeed at individual attempts of these things. Only Human tries to provide this.

## Structure

At the moment there are a couple of parts to this repo. The LaTeX to compile into player-friendly rules is in `only-human.tex`. `rules.md` provides an unstyled (beyond markdown) documentation of the rules, that may be more extensive, in parts, than the LaTeX version, but will probably not print out as cleanly or as compactly.

These two documents may not quite agree. If this is the case, I'm not going to tell you one is the source of truth. Pick whichever you like more.

## Compiling

I recommend compiling the rules with `xelatex`, and you will need the font Economica installed.

Alternately, you could take the much easier route of just downloading the pdf from the [releases page](https://github.com/thewrongjames/only-human-releases).
